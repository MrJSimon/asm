# asm
**asm** is an assisted 2D image segmentation tool built with Python. It employs a Random Forest classifier for pixel-wise segmentation and provides a full-featured GUI for semi-automated workflows.

# Purpose
ASM is designed for researchers and practitioners working in fields that utilize microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-Ray imaging, where precise and efficient 2D segmentation is critical.

1. Quickly load and manage image datasets
2. Create, edit, and organize training masks
3. Extract and select features for classification
4. Train Random Forest models and apply them to unseen images
5. Visualize predictions and overlay segmentations

# Installation
Install **asm** by cloning the repository onto your local machine using the following command

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asm.git

## Requirements

This program was tested using

    python 3.10.9

Install the required Python packages, listed in requirements.txt, with:  

    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Getting started
This package can be executed from a Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VSCode, Spyder) or via the terminal. 

To start the GUI, navigate to the asm package and run:

    python asm\asm-package\start_GUI.py
